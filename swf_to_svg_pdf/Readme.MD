Hopefully it would be converted to C/C++ and remove the need for python here.
At the moment, here are the instructions for running it.

1. Build swftools
2. Install python, python-pip if you haven't done so yet.
3. pip install reportlab
If you are running on Linux and get errors on missing TrueType fonts (Arial.TTF for example), try the following:

sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
